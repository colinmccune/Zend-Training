# View Helpers

In your view scripts, often it is necessary to perform certain complex functions over and over: e.g., formatting a date, generating form elements, etc. You can use helper classes to perform these behaviours for you.

See: http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.view.helpers.html

To use a helper in your view script, call it using $this->helperName(). 

Behind the scenes, Zend_View will load the Zend_View_Helper_HelperName class, create an object instance of it, and call its helperName() method. 

The object instance is persistent within the Zend_View instance, and is reused for all future calls to $this->helperName().


# URL View Helper

url($urlOptions, $name, $reset)

$urlOptions should be an associative array of key/value pairs used by the particular route.
$name => Route name (optional)
$reset => Reset url params (optional)
