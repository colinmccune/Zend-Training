Zend_Layout implements a classic Two Step View pattern, allowing developers to wrap application content within another view, usually representing the site template.
The main goals of Zend_Layout are as follows:

- Automate selection and rendering of layouts when used with the Zend Framework MVC components.

- Provide separate scope for layout related variables and content.

- Allow configuration, including layout name, layout script resolution (inflection), and layout script path.

- Allow disabling layouts, changing layout scripts, and other states; allow these actions from within action controllers and view scripts.

- Follow same script resolution rules (inflection) as the ViewRenderer, but allow them to also use different rules.

- Allow usage without Zend Framework MVC components.
