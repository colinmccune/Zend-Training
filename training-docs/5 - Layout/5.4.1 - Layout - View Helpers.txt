# Placeholder Helper

The Placeholder view helper is used to persist content between view scripts and view instances. It also offers some useful features such as aggregating content, capturing view script content for later use, and adding pre- and post-text to content (and custom separators for aggregated content).

Concrete Placeholder Implementations
Zend Framework ships with a number of "concrete" placeholder implementations. These are for commonly used placeholders: doctype, page title, and various <head> elements. In all cases, calling the placeholder with no arguments returns the element itself.

- Doctype
- HeadLink
- HeadMeta
- HeadScript
- HeadStyle
- HeadTitle
- InlineScript
