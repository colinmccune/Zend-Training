What is a Locale?

In computing, locale is a set of parameters that defines the user's language, country and any special variant preferences that the user wants to see in their user interface.


How are Locale's Represented?

Locale identifiers consist of information about the user's language and preferred/primary geographic region (e.g. state or province of home or workplace).

Locale identifier strings used in Zend Framework are internationally defined standard abbreviations of language and region, written as language_REGION.


Examples:

en = English

en_CA = English Canada

en_US = English USA

fr = French

fr_CA = French Canada
