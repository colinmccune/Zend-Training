(2.3) MVC

Show: "2.3.1 - MVC Diagram"

Talking Point: Separation of concerns, separates your html, database / business logic, and logic that handles the web request.
- Controller: IndexController.php
- Action: Controllers perform 1+ actions.
- View: Views are for presentation (ie: html) and are in the scripts folder (eg: index.phtml)
- Model: Place to store your business logic / database code.

Talking Point: Show Controller and the View in our project. Model doesn't exist yet - we will get to it later.
