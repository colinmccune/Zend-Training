Zend_Paginator is a flexible component for paginating collections of data and presenting that data to users.

The primary design goals of Zend_Paginator are as follows:

- Paginate arbitrary data, not just relational databases
- Fetch only the results that need to be displayed
- Do not force users to adhere to only one way of displaying data or rendering pagination controls
- Loosely couple Zend_Paginator to other Zend Framework components so that users who wish to use it independently of Zend_View, Zend_Db, etc. can do so


# Adapters for Zend_Paginator

Array => Use a PHP array

DbSelect => Use a Zend_Db_Select instance, which will return an array

DbTableSelect => Use a Zend_Db_Table_Select instance, which will return an instance of 

Zend_Db_Table_Rowset_Abstract. This provides additional information about the result set, such as column names.

Iterator => Use an Iterator instance

Null => Do not use Zend_Paginator to manage data pagination. You can still take advantage of the pagination control feature.
