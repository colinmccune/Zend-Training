Intro

Zend_Cache provides a generic way to cache any data.

Zend_Cache makes use of:

- Frontends which are used to capture data that you want to cache.
- Backends which are used to store/persist the captured data.


All cached items have

- A unique identifier (a string) which is used to identify the cached record.

- A lifetime which defines how long a resource is considered fresh.


You can

- Tagging cache records so that you can organize the cache.
- Invalidate individual cached items, groups of tagged items, or the whole cache.
